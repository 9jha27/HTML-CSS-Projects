				<h1>Philosophy</h1>
				<div>
					<summary>
						My greatest joy in teaching is creating a positive environment where a student can freely explore
						their musical values and ideas. Much too often, I find that students have a difficult time
						connecting with their teachers, which can intimidate their creative minds. I have dedicated
						myself for nearly a decade to understanding my students’ needs, both mentally and physically, to
						help them excel.

						In addition, I have a deep understanding of different cultural values which has immeasurable
						assistance in determining what style of teaching fits more with different students. Ranging from
						students in Colombia who are part of the conservatory in Medellin to group classes at an all
						girls’ charter school in Cleveland, OH where attendees were primarily African-American; I am
						highly adaptable in teaching effectively across different cultures. Growing up in a strong,
						traditional Asian family, these teaching experiences have only expanded my understanding of
						cultural differences amongst a beautifully diverse group of students striving for musical
						experiences.
