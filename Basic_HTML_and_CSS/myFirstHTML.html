		<section><h2>In the Beginning...</h2>
			<p>I really couldn't figure out what I wanted to do. I wanted to learn so many things to take advantage of the time I had
			off from work from the symphony. <br>I had always wanted to learn to code, and I was immediately hooked. I think this is the 
			case with many people, but I had many fellow musicians who had switched to coding/programming careers, so I thought I 
			would give it a try!</p>

		<h2><strong>Inspirations</strong></h2>
			<p>I have deep roots in the <em>Korean culture</em>, even though I have only been there a handful of times. My father
			always told me stories about simple times and about sharing a small bedroom with 6 brothers. I will never forget
			the feelings I have when he tells me stories about growing up, playing without technology. I am inspired by 
			simplistic times: straw rooves, white snow, tall grass. It is my goal to design your website with the utmost care
			and the most simplistic touch. </p>
